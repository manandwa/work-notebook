Current Flow

A[Remove Syringe from Start Bin] --> B[Extend Syringe] --> C[Insert Syringe into Fixture] --> D[Hit Foot Pedal] --> E[Cut Syringe] --> F[Remove Syringe from Fixture] --> GF[Place Cut Syringe in Finished goods Bin] --> A;
```

Don't use current fixtures as it is harder to adapt a manual process to automation rather then to start with one that is already taylor made for it.
